#### What's this? ####

onepointeight contains modules of the AppleCraft Minecraft server to be released when Minecraft updates to version 1.8

Use it if you want. I don't care.

These are designed to be the *only* plugins on the server. As such, it's done in modular form so it's not one giant plugin doing everything. If you *do* decide to use it, the plugins that others require are _core_, _region_ and/or _permissions_.

There aren't any autoupdates and it's not designed to work with Vault. Don't expect it to work. It won't do what you want.

That souds pretty pessimistic, so on a brighter note, THIS THING IS SO AWESOME OH MY GOD I LOVE IT <3333333333333333333333

*ahem* ignore that.
